### Week 1

During Week 1, days are split into morning and afternoon training sessions in various computational methods. Each day then ends with a dedicated research talk.

### Week 2

During Week 2, we will be working on either:

1. Collaborative group projects selected from a list provided by instructors
2. Your own group project idea

We will provide a set of groups project ideas that have been suggested by your instructors or other members of Edinburgh Social Science/Informatics Faculty. The idea is that you work on these within your groups with advice from your instructor.
